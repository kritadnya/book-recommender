## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Loads and embeds book descriptions using HuggingFace sentence transformers.
2. Splits and stores the text in a vector database (Chroma).
3. Accepts a natural language query from the user.
4. Retrieves semantically similar books using vector similarity.
5. Applies optional filtering based on category and emotional tone.
6. Displays top results with titles, thumbnails, and descriptions.
